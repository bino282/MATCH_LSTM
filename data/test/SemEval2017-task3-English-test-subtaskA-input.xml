			<RelCText>Hi Aunt Polly, here are the details: 1. Complete your documents, check the website    http://www.eda.admin.ch/eda/en/home/reps/asia/vkwt/ref_visinf/viskwt.html 2. You will have to send your original passports thru DHL or Fedex (they know what to do) at: Embassy of Switzerland in Kuwait (also accredited in Qatar and Bahrain) Qortuba, Block 2, Street 1, House No 122 P.O. Box 23954 Safat 13100 Kuwait Tel. +965 534 01 72/73/74/75 Fax  +965 534 01 76 Public opening hours Sunday-Thursday 9:00-11:00 Visa section: Sunday-Thursday 9:00-11:00 (Kuwait have the same time as we have here in Qatar, so you can call and ask them for more of your questions ONLY on the times stated) 3. You pay a courier charge to Kuwait. Wait in 3-5 working days, it will arrive to you (either approved or denied) and you will again be charged depending if you are approved or not. 4. Enjoy the holidays in Switzerland. Its best to go there during the winters to see the snow-capped mountains and stuff. But summer is ok too.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Aunt Polly, my family and I did it. Yes, even if you check with DHL or Fedex, they know it, and they know what to do. But you'll have to complete your papers adn plan your trip well, as the processing takes (max) of 5 working days in all. Yes, you'll need a separate Schengen Visa for those countries you mentioned (except Holland). The 15 Schengen countries are: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Greece, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. All these countries except Norway and Iceland are European Union members. When you know your 1st Schengen-visa valid country, that will be your visa application. Say, your 1st destination before or after Swiss is Italy, then you have to get your Schengen Visa from the Italian Embassy here. Once you have the visa, you can roam around 15 countries!

			<RelCText>You do not mention what passport you hold. Either way your travel agent should have arranged everything for you. I would be VERY hesitant to travel anywhere in teh world if I did not know what the visa requirements were for a particular country. On the other hand the airline carrying you to Qatar would ultimately be responsible for you and will not allow you to board if your paperwork is not in order. Check out the Qatar Government websites if you have the opportunity. Good Luck.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I guess so...but it seems so uncertain which is strange. I have a british credit card, like Natwest and Alliance and Leicester, I dont know if that counts as international though.

			<RelCText>My parents have only ever visited here with Emirates Airlines. They have been 3 times now and have had no problems whatsoever. However, these new regulations have come in to effect ... but as mentioned, speaking to people who had just had visitors they have had no problems and wasn't asked to provide anything. If you are a bit nervous ... you can get your friends to organise a meet and greet service for you. You can book them at any Qatar Airways office ... doesn't matter what airline you are arriving in. Costs around 70 riyals (can't remember exactly) and they will meet you when you get off the plane, seat you in a room with refreshments then organise your visa .. you can pay a bit extra (10 riyals) and they will even pick up your luggage for you and escort you thru customs It's a great service, especially if you are unsure or nervous. Good luck.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>So ask Emirates. They're required by law to make sure they're not carrying undesirable aliens, so it's in their interest to make sure everything's in order. I'm pretty sure you'll be OK so long as you can persuade immigration that you're a bona-fide short term tourist, which is why a hotel booking is recommended. It might help to have ask your friends for their job details, address &amp; RP number. (They'll know what that is.) If you're at all young or attractive, they'll be suspicious that you might be a prostitute. Note that in all these respects, it's exactly the same for non-EC tourists entering the UK or Brits entering the USA.</RelCText>

My girlfriend is employed by a certain company in Doha for past two months and Iâ€™d be staying at her flat for about 3 weeks.

I was wondering if anyone knew how easy/difficult it is to do this and what would be the costs? Also names and contacts of rental companies.

I will be needing a five door hatchback model, nothing too large or fancy and will be needing to rent for 3 or 4 months. Any advice would be appreciated.</RelQBody>

Speedway Rent a car 444-2299 Ask for Michael You can rent a car with your International Driving License. Legally you can drive with this license for 6 months after your first date of arrival in Doha. But each rental car company has different policy. Some rental car company allow you to rent their car with Internatioal Driving License for 2 months, some for a few weeks. So, you must shop around for more detail. Since, you are from the UK I would recommend you to wait for your company to issue you a letter to obtain a local Qatari Driving License. This letter will be in Arabic and you can obtain a new license on exchange basis. They will just look at your local UK license, give you eyes exam then you are done. Just pay the money and you will get the new Qatari license right away. With Qatari License you can rent a car from anywhere with less restrictions. Qatari Driving License Documents Needed 1.Arabic Letter from your company 2.Passport copy with RP copy 3.Color photo (No white background) If you war glasses or contact lense, you must wear glass while taking picture. 4.Applicaiton Fee payby credit card or ATM card (No cash accepted) 5.Enjoy your new License Goodluck in Doha!</RelCText>

Husband sponsored visa is entirely different because your validity of stay in qatar depends totally on your husband visa status...?

			<RelCText>Families of sponsored residents may enter Qatar on a short-term Family Visit Visa. The visa is valid for one month. However, relatives who wish to stay beyond one month may undergo a physical examination within the first 72 hours of arrival to apply for an extension. The visa can be extended to cover a maximum of six months only (five extendable months for immediate family members and two months for second-degree relatives).</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Rico, you are totally confused. Your visa is issued on May 2nd. You can enter Qatar within 3 months, i.e. any time till July 31st. If you didn’t enter Qatar during this time, your visa is expired and you have to issue new visa. NOW. Let’s say, you entered Qatar on June 01. YOU think that you visa is still valid till July 31, which is wrong. Now your visa validity is calculated from date of your entry. It should be valid 30 days, i.e. if you entered Qatar on June 01, it is valid till July 01 (check the entry stamp in your passport). You can extend this visa till 6 months upon completion of Medical examination. NOW. Type of your visa is a VISIT visa, meaning that you cannot work on this visa. VISIT means VISIT, not work, how people don’t understand it?? NOW. If you want to work in qatar, you have 2 options: 1.Husband takes you under his sponsorship and issues a) Residence permit for you ( although he should meet certain requirements to be qualified to sponsor you) b) Work Permit so that you could legally work; 2.Find a job, and do not even mention your husband, so that the COMPANY can take you under its sponsorship. Clear?</RelCText>

I definitely do not think that her current sponsor wasted their money... She spent an hour with us and played with my son. We were very happy with the way she spoke and conducted herself. If she does not get her NOC then will she have to leave the country?? Is there any way in which I can avoid paying the 6000 QAR? Thanks</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Exactly! they should not charge you any penny as she already worked with them for 4 years! If they send her home, you cannot hire her directly without an NOC she has to wait for another 3 years before she can enter Qatar again. In that sense, there's no way you can avoid paying the QR6,000. If you are going to hire from the agencies you will find out eventually that, you will spend more or less the same amount! If your instinct say she's worth it, then go for it! but if you find it too expensive, as I said there are lots of them looking for job who are already there, it will suit you according to your budget! ;)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>As far as i know, You need to get a NOC letter from your employer, which should state that they have no object to you applying for a maid and also stating your salary, and the nationality of the maid you want to get. Take this to the labour department on C-ring road (i guess), there is an application form that you need to get filled in and submit with the NOC. Will take atleast a week for the approval to come. Once you get the approval, give this to any manpower agency that brings in maids, and they will handle the rest in terms of getting the visa, flights, etc.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I am just thinking from layman point (not expert); I am sure husband and wife can be under different sponsorships (saw it earlier) so if marriage certificate is there, then there should not be issue from legal point of view.

			<RelCText>Friend, You need not to worry about this... i hope it is not coplecated. With your sponser (wife) permission you can admit your wife in to Hamad Hospital, once baby deliverd you can go and register your baby on your Embossey and get pasport.

			<RelCText>1.Go to the NATIONAL HEALTH AUTHORITY and fill application.When they issue cash receipt they will advise you to go to CID office at Industrial Area. 2.You should take a Guarantor passport and take him also to CID office in industrial area. 3.CID will issue a birth certificate and this will help you to take a temporarory PP to your baby. 4.Take this temporory PP to immigration and fill application for new Baby. Remember (A) Baby + mother should go (B) Wear good attire (C)Go to abu hamour immigration early morning.(Officials are gentle) 5.Get the RP for the baby 6.After taking RP go to the CID office to take the PP of your friend. 7.CID chek the legality here.As per Qatar labour law any housemaid can't have baby.So most probably they might not give the PP 8.No problem 9.GO to the NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS in midmac.Tell your story right from the begining. 10.They will issue a letter to Labour department to bring your wife sponsorship under you. 11.Do not waste single minute. 12.Any problem u send me email to gunawathie@yahoo.com, I can help within my limit. 13.Your baby is given by ALLAH only.He is the creator.So pray him and take the VISA.

			<RelCText>yes you can have children legally here as long as you and your wife are legally married and have a marriage certificate. Because when your wife go to hospital for check up and when she will deliver the baby in the hospital, the hospital will ask you to submit the marriage certificate. when you will register to have a Birth Certificate at the Supreme Council for Health they will again ask for the marriage certificate and when you will apply for your baby visa, they will not require for a NOC, just the baby passport, you and your wife passport and RP ID.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>1. Your husband has to check if he can acquire a visa for a maid under his name. 2. He has to apply for that visa. 3. The maid has to be different from your nationality.(that's I am not sure if still the current law) 4. Once your husband has been approved for his application to sponsor a maid, he then can get the visa transfer form. 5. He has to ask your father to sign it and your maid to sign it. 6. Your father has to make a release letter for your maid 7. You can submit those papers to the Immigration. I hope the above could help you, I am no immigration expert here, I just read those previou thread and gather the above informations from it. I am not sure also, how long it will take (the processing) Goodluck! Cheers!

			<RelCText>i am not very good at directions, so let me try. if you can find your way to the areas after passing muntaza garden, its also called rawdah al khalil gardens, has been closed for quite some time. if you go past this route to the inner roads which could take you to the muntaza health centre, shaheen centres, and the signals that lead you to andalus petrol station. did you get my location? ok in this area before you head to the centres i have mentioned you will find there are many tailors and i have seen some wedding dresses on display. you could check out al rawdah tailors, in this area.there are lots of abbaya shops here too.so it wont be difficult for you to find the shops and they usually have a catalogue of designs with them. happy heart drive safe because someone is waiting for you at home</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Those used to speaking slang might nor notice the gramatical error, but it's there (as everyone already ponted out).     "He's" implying "he has" is only used in slang and is technically gramatically incorrect because "he's" is supposed to be a replacement for "he is". Aslo, the term thin vs the term slender is not really a gramatical infrigement (although I do agree with you that it may have been more appropriate under the current circumstances). Stay safe. Perfection does not exist. The question therefore, is: what level of imperfection are we willing to settle for?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I have also became the member of Vacation International, I have paid around 6300QR out of total contract value (18000QR)but after reading the online complaints about this travel agency, I am not able to take decision either to cancel the contract or go ahead. I have to pay remaining amount in installments (340QR /month). If I have to cancel the contract I will loose 40% of contract value (i.e. 7200QR). It is true that they don't have any website, and they have informed the the website is under construction. Also there are complaints about this travel agency in Dubai.

			<RelCText>Dear Don2 nothing more to share you are already trapped and me too. i have paid 4700 for 6 nights in any of the coutry from the list. and two weeks in sharmalsheikh free according to them but its not free they have already charged the full rent in 4700 with meals again they will sell meal coupons for 140 each person. so if u stay sh shk for two weeks you have to pay almost 5000 more for food which you have alredy paid. only thing you can get back from them is 6 nights in malaysia which cost max 1200. but to get it back you have to pay 6000 for tickets for two. its absolutly horrible deal i have made in my life. and still they are so shameless people saying alhamdullillah and they are muslims etc etc.if you want to sve money dont pay installments i did not pay and my loss is still at 4700.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I lived in Dubai for a year (2006-2007) and I still go there every 2-3 weeks on business. Dubai is definitely the place to be. It is as expensive as Doha, but atleast there are a million things to do, social life is amazing, they have a proper infrastructure in place, things happen in Dubai, unlike Doha. The d-ring and industrial roundabout have been closed for a very long time here. In the same time, Dubai has built roads, bridges and highways to wrap Doha several times over. Construction boom in Doha? You got to be kidding! Check out the real boom in Dubai. Career opportunities? Dubai of course. Lifestyle and going out? Dubai. Having fun? Dubai. Driving? Dubai of course. Everything else? Dubai. So why am I here? Not for long... as soon as I can, I am moving back.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Compared to Doha, Dubai has: More nightclubs and nightlife. More nationalities, less locals. More buildings. More Business/Trade. Extremely bad traffic (Qatar's traffic is getting just as bad). Bizarrely Dubai's Internet services are more restrictive (I noticed flickr and skype are banned there!). I don't know which of these are better or worse, you be the judge.</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>Hiya,  We may be moving to Qatar in the next couple of months. I'll try to find answers in old queries when I can, please bear with dumb questions with that in mind! Apart from obvious things like pork, are we able to bring food to Qatar? Specifically, dried food like Malaysian anchovies (ikan bilis) and Chinese Mushrooms. We have a fairly large stock in New Zealand, and don't want to waste it........ What a pity that I'll have to drink the cellar dry before I leave   Cheers, Tom </RelQBody>

			<RelCText>Your license is Indian national not inter national. Yes you can get license provided you pass the test. For some countries they allow without test but you are not from one of those countries. Also GCC valid license holders need to just exchange their license for a fee.

			<RelCText>OH MY GOD ... You people are giving her the wrong information!!!!! Medical exam IS REQUIRED for extension of family visit visa. (this is what I did for my family) The requirement states: If the visitor wants to stay more than one month inside the country, he/ she has to undergo a medical test before the month ends. The visa is renewable for five months for immediate family (father, mother, sister, sons) and two months for other relations. Get the official requirement here from Hukoomi website: 1. Go to Hukoomi. (you can google it) 2. Go to How do I? 3. Select get residence visa for family 4. On the next page, click on "for more information, click here" 5. On list of services, click on "Visas for Family Visits" Hope this helps and do your medical (at the Medical Commission) soonest. Don't forget to do the blood grouping first.</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>Hello, I need to get health insurance for my wife. I'm covered by my company's insurance, but she is not. I have read about something called "government health card", which seems to cost QR100 per person per year. Would be grateful for info on how this works, and where she can apply. She is currently on a tourist visa, since our family visa is still being processed (I got my RP very recently). Can she still apply for insurance, or would she have to get the family visa first?</RelQBody>

			<RelQBody>Hello everyone!!! Im soon arriving at Doha (hopefully sooner than I think). I wanted to raise the question: Is it safe to bycicle around Doha? I don´t want to go through the whole process to get a driving permit, so...I thought I could buy a bycicle. Since Im not really that interested in having a car and on the other hand It´s quite healthy. What do you think guys? Is it safe and practical to cycle around Doha?</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>I'm sorry you failed 3 times but there is no other way to get a license than to pass the test. I failed once and then I took to driving classes (short course) just to know what they are looking for on the road test and also mainly because we do not have a lot of roundabouts back in our country. I found out that they are particular about your car's position before approaching a roundabout when you are going right, left or straight. Try to go into a short course to bring up your confidence.</RelCText>

Rather than wasting money by failing in direct test . Join a course.

Bring all requirements listed, including: letter from company stating your salary/position and tenure official bank statement (6 mos i think) your work visa passport picture marriage contract (in case ur bringing wife) and some other (just pls dbl check in the website) Always bring the original + photocopy when you get there, after filling up the forms, they will gather all your documents and put it in a sealed envelope -- everything will be couriered to UK in 24 hrs and even the result is sealed when u get it back, so the VSF people do not really have a say on the results. btw, they will also get your fingerprints and picture and signature, all digital. Payment is about 400QR for 6 mos visit visa. Goodluck!</RelCText>

			<RelQBody>Do US citizens living in Qatar for longer than 11 months a year and paid through a Qatari bank still have to fill out tax forms and send them to the USA, or can one simply forget about the IRS and not worry about it? If so, is there a maximum salary exemption and does one have to include housing and other perks? Thanks for your help! I hope I can kiss the IRS goodbye!</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>Yeah right! They will hunt us down until the day we die and probably even after that. Here's a few things from the IRS site. You (and I) really need to ask a professional because it's tricky and I really don't know what to do. I have read something else before about living out of the country for all but 30 days of the year and that being one of the reasons for exemption but I can't find the exact wording... http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/international/article/0,,id=97324,00.html If you are a U.S. citizen or resident alien living or traveling outside the United States, you generally are required to file income tax returns, estate tax returns, and gift tax returns and pay estimated tax in the same way as those residing in the United States. Your income, filing status, and age generally determine whether you must file a return. Generally, you must file a return if your gross income from worldwide sources is at least the amount shown for your filing status in the Filing Requirements table in Chapter 1 of Publication 54, Tax Guide for U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens Abroad If you are a U.S. citizen or a resident alien of the United States and you live abroad, you are taxed on your worldwide income. However, you may qualify to exclude from income up to $82,400 of your foreign earnings. In addition, you can exclude or deduct certain foreign housing amounts.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Here's something else. Let me know if you do talk to a professional because right now I've been operating on the "ignorance-is-bliss" philosophy which isn't that smart! Significant Penalty Imposed for Not Filing Expatriation Form The Internal Revenue Service reminds practitioners that anyone who has expatriated or terminated his U.S. residency status must file Form 8854, Initial and Annual Expatriation Information Statement (PDF). Form 8854 must also be filed to comply with the annual information reporting requirements of Internal Revenue Code section 6039G, if the person is subject to tax under Section 877 of the Code. A $10,000 penalty may be imposed for failure to file Form 8854 when required. IRS is sending notices to expatriates that have not complied with the Form 8854 requirements, including the imposition of the $10,000 penalty where appropriate. The Instructions for Form 8854 (PDF) provide details about the filing requirements, related definitions and line-by-line instructions for completing the form. Failure to file or not including all the information required by the form or including incorrect information could lead to a penalty.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>i didn't understand, did they promiss you a work visa nd residence permit? or what's your question? Do you want to go home? or you want to stay and work here? I don't get you. But anyway, if your business visa is expiring first time (meaning you are in Qatar less than 30 days), and you have to leave the country, you don't need an exit permit. Check your ticket, may be it has return flight. Just go to the airport and leave. If not, ask your company what they are planning for you. we cannot know here what your company's arrangment is. To send you home? to extend your visa? to issue work visa and RP for you? ask your manager.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>What you need to prepare: • Approval letter from your company immigration with regards to sponsoring visit visa. • Copy of your passport • Copy of the passport of the one you're about to visit Salary Statement in English for Embassy purposes Steps on how to process your application: • Go to Immigration Department in Gharafa • Go to the Typing Section and state that you would like to visit someone (present to him the letter from your company immigration, copy of your passport &amp; copy of the passport of the one you're about to visit) pay him 10Qrs. • Go to Building 4 for the processing and issuance of visa. • If you will visit someone in direct connection with you (i.e. father, mother, brother, sister, wife, son, daughter) they will issue directly the visa from building 4. But if you will visit someone which is not in direct connection with you (i.e. Auntie, Uncle, Cousin, Friend) you will need approval from the Director from Building 1, 1st floor. • The timings in the Immigration Department is from 6:30am - 1:00pm &amp; 3:00pm - 7:00pm; For the visa you need to pay 200Qrs. and check the availability of the Visa thru www.moi.gov.qa/site/... after 3hours of issuance of receipt. For Filipino Citizens: You need to prepare Affidavit of Support that you can get from the Philippine Embassy Doha. You just have to present to them your salary statement, copy of your passport &amp; the one that you're about to visit, this will take you 1day for the processing of Affidavit of Support. This Affidavit of Support will be presented by the one you're about to visit in the Immigration Section at the NAIA. What does the one that you're about to visit need to do? • He/She needs to send to Qatar Embassy to the Philippines thru DHL these things: • Original Passport, • 2pcs. 2x2 ID picture with white background, • Printed visa copy and wait for 5 working days till they send you back your passport with visa sticker. Coming to Doha: He/She needs to bring His/Her Passport, Affidavit of Support, Copy of the sponsor passport, ticket &amp; money.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>As far as i know, that is not so difficult.  If you know any mandoub, ask him for help and explain that you want to sponsor someone not related to you. Even your travel agent can arrange for it.  Al Deera is one example.  They can book you in Al Maha Services at the airport.  They will provide everything from visa processing up to clearing at immigration here at the airport. You have to check if her nationality is among those who are being granted visa at the airport. Examples are: ·         USA ·         Greece ·         France ·         Germany ·         Sweden ·         Italy   If not, then you have to process at least 3 days prior to her departure.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>you could set appointment by bringing the copy of receipt and then they will put the date and time on it. in my case, the appointment was set 1 month after I requested for the meeting. so many reasons why application is rejected. if they have problem on your papers they will tell you, if that can still be supported by providing other documents, then they might put the status under "postpone" while waiting for your other papers. They will not tell you rightaway after the meeting regarding the result, you have to wait for 3 days or more. continuously check the result on internet if the remarks will change. if still the same after 5 days then most probably still rejected. Just my advice, they might ask only 3 questions which has something to do with your work or family, even if they ask less make it sure that you express your willingness and your capacity to support your family here. Good luck</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Dear Mr.Valappil88, i heard a rumor last month, baladiya stamp in tenancy agreement document is withheld due to many family visa rejections by immigration. then i submitted my documents. the doc. receiving counter also not commented about this baladiya stamp issue. i was happy while they given receipt for visa processing. after a week days i shocked to see this bad result. now i am waiting for "Lajna meeting". i hope they will accept my new tenancy contract with baladiya stamp from another landlord.</RelCText>

			<RelQSubject>TOURIST VISA TO FAMILY VISIT VISA</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>Hello and Good morning to all! I would just like to ask if I can change my husband and children's tourist visa into a family visit visa? I brought my family here in Qatar on a tourist visa and I am hoping to change them to a family visit visa before their tourist visa expires. Will somebody please give me an option what to do? I have read from this site that migs 1296 was able to convert his wife visa from tourist to family visit visa. I don't know how to contact him.. Please help</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>The only way for you to transfer them to family visit is by exiting the country, and coming back using the Family Visit Visa. there is no such transfer, but you can transfer it into "husband or Father" sponsorship. Visit visa, they need to exit, have their existing visit visa be cancelled, and enter with the new one. this way, they have maximum stay of 6 months. It's not because things are difficult that we don't dare, it's because we don't dare that makes things difficult!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>They don't have to exit, providing it is done before the current visit visa runs out, Check with your company's P.R.O they should be the one doing it for you. You can't just sponsor them yourself even though you have an RP you still need your company to grant you permission first and depending what type of sponsorship you have will depend on whether you are eligible or not.

			<RelCText>Bring her over under visit visa first then when your visa is ready for her to transfer just go to Immigration and they will put the visa under her name. no problem even you brought her over under visit visa it's even better than kadama visa straight away because she has to go through lots of processing in our end. this is what we normally do nowadays to avoid all the long procesing.

			<RelCText>hi bowlers21! they have already allowed housemaid sponsorship for same nationality. this was since last week of december2007 i think. so if you are interested, you might also wanna try. if you can bring her by visit visa, it will be beneficial on your part so you have to spend much. i know the immigration already squeezed a big amount from you when you applied. to answer your question, yes it is transferable. you will need to pay for QR1800 for the visa issuance for the housemaid. how long will it take? i dont know. it will depend on your efforts because it is personal sponsorship. good luck! silent "G"</RelCText>

I have a friend with a wife n 4 kids who always brags about spending no more than 1000 a month on all groceries. But that's done by waking up at 5 AM n driving to the industrial area or the farms to buy the veggies n meat n the waterfront to buy fish.

			<RelCText>If you like animals then do not go to the zoo. It is absolutely horrific. The animals are malnourished and kept in cages way to small. I think it should be shut down.

			<RelCText>my passport just expired this month and my working visa was on it. but before the expiration date, i happen to renewed the thing last month and also did inform our office about it. According to them... Yes, they have to transfer your qatari visa to your new passport, which it did happen to me and our liason officer asked 50 riyals for it...... Only in qatar they do that or middle east...,,, i guess. co'z i've worked in other countries like brunei and even singapore,they dont do that, they just staple your new and old passport together without transerring the visa to your new passport and during traveling, immigration officers just ask about the old passport.it's a different system they have.......anyway, i hope this info will help you.... &lt;fo</RelCText>

			<RelCText>When you send your old passport to get renewed, they will attach both of them the new and the old. When you get them back just go to the immigration and they will cancel both, the old passport and old visa and issue you a new visa with the same details of the old one. Don't worry about it, should take nothing more than 5 minutes to print the new visa and stick it on the new passport.

			<RelQBody>Hello Everyone: I parked car outside mall the other day in late evening and next morning I discovered there is a 2 feet long scratch on right side of the car. I did not notice before as i left from left side of car (from diriving seat) and came back same way. Now, should I check if someone has already reported this incident and how can I check it? What afterwards would be required to get the claim from insurance? Thanks and Regards</RelQBody>

			<RelCText>(before oct 2nd) ... they have new law now. The normal procedures to report to the police exactly what happend. They will then ask you to return in 2 weeks. Hence given time for the other party to report. If no one report ... you can get the police letter / certificate, with that you can go to the garage to get it fix (via insurance). Not too sure what is the right procedure after getting a letter from the police.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Thank novita, you always take a lead :) Are the police stations (muroors) inter-connected? I was told the one close to landmark is the main one.

			<RelCText>If you go and make complain and if you are not claiming full insurance then you will get the papers immediately. The police will just look at the damage make a report and ask you to put a QR5/- stamp. Thats all you just take the paper and go to any garage of your choice. Other wise you may have to wait for a few days sometimes as less as 3 and after that they will give you the report. I think if you are going to claim insurance then you need to pay QR 100/- at the traffic dept I think before they give you the paper to take to the insurance company.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>So as a follow-up point to this, in Qatar, even if you physically damage your own vehicle on accident (back into a lamp post, get too close to the pole, etc. etc.), you have to go get a police certificate to have the damage fixed? I'm not saying OP damaged their own car, but just curious. I didn't think the 2/10 laws coming in changed accident procedures in that way. I thought it was traffic safety stuff which got changed. Or that's how it sounded in the newspaper, anyway.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>procedure is like this. 1. You have to got to Airport Traffic Police as the mall is in their area of control. No any other branch will accept your report. 2. You will be asked to after 2 weeks to collect the report. 3. Collect the report and go to your insurance co. 4. They will inspect your car and take picutes and endorse your police report immediatly. 5. With that go to the dearlers workshop or workshop of your choice.

			<RelQSubject>Where I can report prank callers?</RelQSubject>

			<RelCText>I had the exact same thing happen on Salwa road here with a large truck with no mudflaps behind its wheels kicking up rocks into my windshield and cracked it. I took the # plate down and gave it to my insurance company. I paid the deductible and my insurance paid for the rest of the replacement costs. FWIW, back home in the US (varies by state) it is mandatory the insurance company replaces the windshield with any cracks in it at no cost!

I just have a problem with my landlord, as they already asked us to vacate the house. Now, i still have a cheque as a deposit and he still hasn't returned it to me.  So i went to the bank and asked them to cancel the payment for that cheque. Guess what, they said they can't do that unless i go to the police first and get a report.  Weird for something like this.  That is my account and i should have the prerogative to cancel the payment.  It is my problem if somebody tries to cash the cheque and finds out it has been cancelled, right?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>What the police report is for is should your landlord present the cheque (out of malice) is negaite you from the responsiblity. If you stop the cheque without the police report or by not having the money in the account then you are the person responsible and it means that you can be arrested and detained by the police till you make the payment. so your land lord wins if you go to the police present your case and get the report to present to the bank then should your landlord present the cheque then you have done nothing wrong and he cannot claim the money and wont be able to claim the money and you won't end up in jail.</RelCText>

There was no independent confirmation from Qatar's Ministry of Interior, but the sources involved with consular services say there has been a significant drop in requests for PCCs. taken from http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/Display_news.asp?section=Local_News&amp;subsection=Qatar+News&amp;month=September2006&amp;file=Local_News200609073221.xml</RelCText>

Yes Insha'Allah you meet the minimum requirement which is 7000qr and you have already been here 2 years so it should be quite straight forward for you to apply for your daughter. Please go to this link www.gov.qa . Click on "apply for family visa" it will tell you all the criteria and explain the procedure. You may also download the application form from that site. All the best.</RelCText>

With diets its not so much how often you eat but just the amount (portion control) and the type of food.  Its also about managing to eat food that you like(apart from junk) so you can continue to eat healthy every day.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Ok before any more well intentioned eating and exercise tips start arriving. Let me point out that I leave home at 6:20 in the morning, and don't get back home until 8:30 in the evening. Cooking is out of the question, and all I want to do is fall into bed so exercise is out as well. The Cambridge Diet uses convientient, safe and efective products that I can fit into my day, and have great results. That is why I am looking for a supplier here.

			<RelCText>for your info: "The Cambridge Diet is a controversialvery low calorie diet involving severe calorie restriction combined with nutritional supplementation. It was developed in 1970 by Dr. Alan Howard at Cambridge University, United Kingdom as a method of rapidly shedding weight while reducing loss of lean body weight. The core principle of the diet is severe calorie restriction, as low as 400 calories/day, combined with supplements of minerals, vitamins and fatty acids to reduce the loss of nutrients typical of severe calorie restriction. However, experts note that some essential nutrients may still be lost, leading to potential problems such as heart arrythmias and other side effects. As a result, it is claimed that the diet in its original form has contributed to a number of deaths." read more here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cambridge_Diet</RelCText>

			<RelCText>According to the little information I know, circumcised means less friction. Guess thats why they are relating it to cutting down down. I am coming from a country with various religions. For Muslims, as well as the Jews, it is compulsory and usually it is done within a month from birth. But I remember that some Christian guys were circumcised when they are old for hygienic reasons. I don't know what is involved in "hygienic" and never asked. Ladies please do not read the following story. A Christian friend of mine told me an incident that happened to his relative (a male) and they made fun out of it. Usually, our culture is that the girl should be virgin. SO that guy on his wedding night and while doing his "duties" had that "annex" removed due to the incident and wrong meneuvers and started bleeding. His relatives and friends started saying that instead of the bride loosing her virginity, it ended up that the groom lost his virginity. Now you can read the remaining part ladies. Regards</RelCText>

			<RelCText>circumcision is a must!, I can't believe other people and in most places do not do this practice. well... Research studies indicate that there are good medical reasons why your son should be circumcised. These include: * Circumcision substantially reduces an infant´s chances of getting a urinary tract infection (UTI) during the first year of his life. Although the rate of urinary tract infections for infants is not very high (around xxx %), UTI´s are becoming increasingly difficult to treat (see here for a discussion). * Cancer of the penis - that effects xxx men in a thousand - is essentially eliminated in circumcised males. * Research shows that males who are circumcised have a lower risk of getting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). In addition, partners of circumcised males are less likely to contract vaginal infections (e.g. yeast infections). * Circumcision eliminates foreskin infections that occur throughout childhood. * Circumcision prevents phimosis, a narrow opening that makes it impossible to retract the foreskin at a later age. * Genital hygiene is easier after circumcision. * Circumcision virtually eliminates the accumulation of smegma.</RelCText>

I worked with a Jewish firm in London (terrific sense of humour against themselves).

			<RelCText>Forgive me for being so dumb but I don't get the story about the Christian guy. Do you mean he knocked on the wrong foor and suffered some injury? I don't know much about circumsion. For those of us born in the United States in the 1960s it was normal procedure for all male babies and was done within days of birth. I was one of those babies and it never occurred to me to ask why it was done. In my case, not for religious reasons as I am not Muslim or Jewish. Since I have always been circumcised I don't know what the alternative is like. Maybe the ladies have a view on this. Victory attained by violence is tantamount to a defeat, for it is momentary.

			<RelCText>im no einstein, but in other cultures it's answered plainly coz its not necessary. religion wise, i think in general, its forbidden coz it's considered for them aesthetics which is not allowed. simply put in layman's terms..like tattoos are forbidden, its not allowed to put silicone in your humps, so as its forbidden to cut that foreskin in you shaft. for them it's considered unnecessary. if its not necessary its vanity. vanity is a no-no.</RelCText>

And they may take it upon themselves to rat you out . I would question the overall sanitary conditions of any illigal opperation here in doha.

			<RelCText>grade 106 is for clerical work. accomodation is in a flat in which 1 staff per room. if there is 3 room in a flat then 3 staff will occupy them. place of accomodation will depend on where is available. there are lots of accomodation for hamad and all of them are not near to the hospital where you will work. promotion? well, you have to count years before you are promoted but do not expect to much because for the grade 106, i think the minimum years is 5-10 years before you will be promoted.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>If you just want to visit a general practitioner then you could try Dr Pamela at Al Ahli.  She is Scottish and is very approachable and knows her stuff.  I took my daughter to her as she had a serious urine infection, the treatment she received was second to none and she was referred to a great Urologist at Al Ahli as well.  You dont need a referral to see Dr pamela just phone Al Ahli hospital and go through to the appointments section (sometimes it diverts to voicemail but go back to the Operator and they will transfer you direct to the appointments desk)  Hope this helps.   know from experience what a nightmare it can be finding a really good GP out here.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>What I understand, your husband should go by Himself and speak to the higher authority. Mandoop can guide your husband specially if your husband cant speak arabic. But still people in immigrations are all professional. They need some explaination more from your husband rather than from your mandoop. This does not mean you can get it if you go there. Sometimes you have to come not only once, twice but sometimes more than 3 times. So let your husband prepare all the papers and go by himself. Speak to higher authority and get the document signed. Hope ou can get it!</RelCText>

Then when he is coming, be sure to have an affidavit of support attested here,(saying that you will be supporting your husband althroughout his stay in Qatar) since it will be asked in the Philippine immigration...and of course, he should be very familiar with your address and work here since...again....it will be asked in the Philippine immig.

			<RelCText>this is a real problem, i believe. as far as I know, no accrediated university/college offers provides a 100% distant learning bachelors degree programme. They'd require you to study FULL-TIME or Atleast spend 2 years at the college/university. However you could get executive certificate, diploma programs etc. http://www.u21global.edu.sg/Education/About/Offices#ua but that'd be overly expensive, and might not be as useful for you, as for any graduate person. If you can afford to stay away from work for 2 years atleast go back to your home country to get a bachelors, or try QU/CNAQ Qatar or Dubai universities if you can afford. I hope and wish you could get scholarship. always try to treat yourself better, the way you deserve</RelCText>

He sleeps out of 6 hours at home 2-3 hours, so literally she stays with him awake around 3-4 hours which are great. He always sounds happy when I call to check on him. My husband also bombards her with calls asking her about our son. Our son makes noises and sings when I talk toher on the phone and even when I get home he is singing. I know them he is ok and happy.

			<RelCText>It is very serious to leave the country and not pay debts, banks in general don't like this even if there is an insurance to cover bad debts. If we have debts, we are responsible to act accordingly to pay the debts, otherwise anyone can come to Qatar, borrow money, and then disappear - hmmm I don't think so -  this is a capital offence. His best bet is to check with the bank to see if they have done anything i.e. informed the police or CID otherwise there is a high risk that he will be arrested upon arrival at Doha.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>If the bank has already informed the authorities and you are on the black list, it is a problem... unless you sort out with the bank and they clear your name . Clearing the name again can be a problem since the offence is a state offence and not a matter of the bank only.. If they have not informed the bank... talking and sorting things out may help.... All depends on the amount... Normally bank may not care about small amounts, unless big enough to cover the cost of following it up...

My husband (my sponsor) went to the Immigration in Al Gharraga and was told to provide NOC from the previous nationality. They said no need the NOC from the embassy of the new passport. So I went to my former embassy and got the NOC. As far as I know, you will be needing the NOC together with the filled-up form (change of nationality) and copies of the old and new passports. We submitted all the paper works last week and told to come back in 2 weeks. You will be given a receipt that they have received the documents. By the way, the form must be filled-up and signed by your sponsor. Regards</RelCText>

After getting the visa and approval from the srilankan embassy, she sends me an sms that i need to send the money for the insurance. I dont know if it is srilankan govt policy or not, but if I have already got the approval from the embassy, I'm assuming it is insurance to protect her in case she gets into any trouble abroad.

			<RelCText>I will explain the insurence produre 1st. There is a government regulation that all workers irrespective of their job catogory have to pay a fee to the government something like RS. 11,000 for 2 years which includes insurence cover for any eventuallity (House maids fee should be cheeper. you can chek that with sri lankan embassy here. if you have a problem getting info from the embassy PM me. Charge de Affairs is a personal friend of mine). Nodody will be allowed leave Sri Lanka without the paid stamp in their passport. They will be stopped at the airport by the officials if they don't have that stamp. This amount shall be paid by the employee in most cases but it is up to you to negotiate that with your maid. Why don't you send her a a contract letter and the visa document, so she's on the safe side. So do you. She needs to sign one copy and send it back to you. yes you need to send the original of the contract attested by sri lanka embassy in qatar for her to obtain this stamp from the immigration department back in sri lanka. no stamp from the qatar embassy here on the contract means she will not be able to secure the immigration stamp in Sri Lanka. You may contact me through PM if you need more info.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>please take a read through this site http://www.messybeast.com/handrear.htm I have gone through it and it gives you the info you need to hand rear this kitten. However, I must warn you, that handrearing such tiny kitten can be harrowing and success is only 20 - 40%. Meaning, no matter how well you take care of it, death is always a nearby factor. Please don't let it upset you or feel like you've done something wrong if this happens. Kittens, unlike puppies are way more sensitive and require mom's care and attention more than puppies do. Also, there is a reason that the mom left this kitten behind - she probably felt it wasn't going to survive - survival of the fittest and all that.... 1) Don't feed cows milk - You will find Baby Kat milk at the vets - they will also have kit for you to feed the kitten with. 2) Do keep the kitten as warm as possible - they cannot regulate their own body temperature - so finding a hot water bottle( a difficult task in Doha, I have tried) or a heating pad will work as an external source of heat - never putting the kitten directly on these items as they can scold, or electricute in the case of the heating pad. 3) Do make sure to keep the kittens bowels stimulated with warm damp cotton wool - this is done after the 6 feeds at 3 hourly intervals. You rub the cotton wool over the kitten's private areas in the same manner the mom would lick the kitten to do the same. Please do read the site info I have given you, and try to find anything else useful on the internet pertaining to hand rearing kittens.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I cannot tell you how important it is to keep the kitten warm - use a small box, or one that will fit the hot water bottle or the heating pad, alone with a towel to cover those items - you can use a themometer and adjust the heat as described in the article I have given you. Do put a fluffy toy in with the kitten... it won't feel so alone. Don't get a fright to, if the kitten starts to deficate on its own inside its bed, this will happen too, but don't forget to stimulate it too. A kitten should urinate often, but in my experience, they only deficate 1 time a day, 2 times at the most in the first 1/2 weeks... there after it becomes more frequent.</RelCText>

If QL Admin is reading this post, with All Due Respect Sir/Madam, you could have at least sent me PM saying about my mistake. i've been out in QL for a long time now and just posting "Found Lost Persian Cat" as a sign of care for an animal and for the person who own this cat.

			<RelCText>I'm no legal expert but the penalties for overstaying your visa will be heavy monetarily I assume. There have in the past been instances of people arriving without documents. The penalties for employing someone without the correct paperwork will be heavy. There have been amnesties in the past in Qatar. Recent cases in Abu Dhabi have also resulted in 2 months prison and a fine for sheltering such illegals.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>these are two different things.. Tepgam67 is asking about Work permit while being on Family visa. shapil is talking about residence permit. that's what happens when unprofessional people try to give an advice. Tepgam67, if you have an RP here, to obtain a Work permit you need police clearance and the contract certified in MOL. How long it takes to finalize the process depends on several factors. ometimes it takes 3-4 days, sometimes it takes 1 month and even more. If you don't have an RP here (i.e. you are on 6 months family visa), you cannot work, and therefore you cannot obtain a Work permit.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>you are welcome, shapil, it is never late to learn. again you mix two things. You are already on Work VISA here in qatar. Based on your Work VISA you got your RP. You don't need an additional work PERMIT, since your visa is a WORK visa. Clear? Work PERMIT is required for those who are on the Family Visa and wish to work. The author of this thread is on Family Visa and already has her RP, I guess. She might stay in Qatar on Family visa without working (while you cannot stay on Work visa without working). But now she has chosen to work. And all she needs now is a PERMISSION to WORK (Work Permit). I hope this time you see the difference. If not, just drop it..</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Last week, I submitted my passort together w/ the copy of my visa for VISA STAMPING thru DHL. It was returned to me unprocessed because Qatar Embassy requires my passport to be authenticated ( maybe because it is old-type GREEN passport, though it will expire in 2015. Since the authentication will take 1 month to process (as informed to me by DFA),I decided to renew my passport instead. The problem is my renewed passport no. (maroon passport) will not be the same with my passport no. indicated in my VISA (green passport). What should I do? Would the Embassy still visa-stamp on my new passport?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Minoush, make sure you have a spare tire and then if you get a flat just pull over and either look helpless or change to the spare yourself. Then drive to one of the many garages and they will patch your flat in no time for 15 QAR. Also, for a breakdown, see if your auto dealer/service center has roadside service. Mine, Al Fardan, does. But once when I came to a dead stop (for no apparent reason) at one of the traffic lights on Al Sadd Rd (I forget the cross street now) it took the guy 2 hours to find me. Mandi</RelCText>

He should avoid prolonged standing and pressure like carrying heavy things, to avoid bleeding. It will be better for him to see any surgeon for that matter. If it is already big and can't be pushed inside anymore then he should undergo laser surgery.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Anyways chief, that's not a bad area but truly speaking it is getting a bit out of reach from the city and it is a bit of an isolated area...you might want to check villas on this side of the Horse Track, for example, somewhere near the sports city or near the 2 shopping malls...those are a good area...speaking of which whats the rent looking like chief...? ---------------------------------------------- " Live Life To The Fullest !

			<RelCText>I think abut 11000 QR (i think). I know it seems a long way off, but its so near the shopping malls i mentioned earlier. Plus there looks to be a family fodd store just down the road. I must say, some of the houses around look quite big. The one that i am talking about has 3 beds 2 baths plus another toilet. I also noticed quite a few that had large walls are a gate around them them. One set had a few villas in and a big gate to go into. Not sure yet which is the one for rent.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Since you understand Jaidah flyover, this is the direction to Bonanza (the best place for quality taste but down market for "treat"). Leave the Jaidah flyover while driving from Ramada and take a U-turn below the flyover. Then turn first right inside-that area is bin Mehmoud. Cross first red light straight and 5 shops before the next signal on the right is Bonanza. Today a new Vegetarian restaurant called Vasant Bhawan is opened on the Crazy signal in Aljazeera Appartments building. This could be worth a try. Quiet lurker. Poor Contributer</RelCText>

			<RelCText>the best spot to catch hamour these days are ALGHARIYA resort if u can get in,coz they dont allow bachelors on weakend.otherwise, u can drive to khor aludied and try ur luck,the best bait probably is the small squid,use 9cm long , full piece on a single no 12 hook,with a steel wire.I caught a 3 kilo hamour at khor al udeid last weakend,but u have to spend the whole night.u can also catch big baracuda with a drifting float at the same location with a full 10 cm long sardine on a treble hook with steel wire.hope this helps</RelCText>

			<RelCText>braggadocio, well you can try Inland sea,if you have a SUV,alghariya is still good if you can be there early morning before sunrise as the guys on jet skies have ruined the waters there.umm said is also a good spot if you fish at night time.for onshore fishing I prefer to use lure,preferably rapala 45 grams.14cm lure.floating or a sardine.if you like you can also use live bait it will give good result.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>if you are too busy to cook, join a food mess. there is one at the Sri Lankan restaurant - Majestic for about QR300 per month which includes lunch &amp; dinner. for breakfast, there is another Sri Lankan restaurant - Salamath ( go down the road where Anana's is located) you have to pay a monthly fee of Qr. 250 - which works more like a deposit. you can eat against the paid Qr 250. they have a separate card for each customer who joins this programme of them &amp; at the end of every month they evaluate your total budget against the paid QR250. if you have eaten for more than the paid QR250, you have to re-pay them the balance or if you have eaten less than QR250, they will carry on the balance to the following month. how ever in both scenarios, you are also entitled for a 10% discount of what you have eaten for that particular month. also you can have all 3 meals there. how ever, it is better to contact them first :) hope this info was useful :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Not sure why there is such confusion this late in November. Home Center has the fiber optic trees (half-size) in their backroom. MegaMart near Ramada has MANY varieties of trees. Dasman still hasn't received theirs. And Carrefour can't decide whether or not to keep stocked or sell out and let the emptiness speak for itself. There are other small sales places around Doha (similar to MegaMart's multi-mini-shop method) that have some. Just don't hold your breath on a REAL wood tree. :^P</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I have had both, and the mess of the real wooden tree is worth the scent and flavor of being poked by real pine needles and enjoying the natural variety. But in Qatar, it is not worth the huge expense of getting a dried out, underbred, withered and scrawny wooden tree. Btw, Home Center in the City Centre Mall now has x3 varieties of trees (including full size), as well as many decorations. Note: Still cannot find a decent star or similar decoration for the top of my tree. Family Food carries cheap plastic types, though they DO sell the Santa caps (in Al Nasser), Mega Mart has an option though not a star.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>would these products happen to come with a limited-calorie diet plan as well, by any chance? I'm guessing you probably weren't on the Pizza Hut diet plan when you were taking them? The only reason you lost weight is because your calories were significantly reduced, not because of some silly little herbal pill. Regardless, GNC over here (there's one in city centre mall) sell a load of pointless herbal tat for the gullible, with such claims as "Guaranteed to work!!!!!

			<RelCText>No, I eat shake for breakfast with cereals and juice or milk, befor shake i took my fibres and herbs - for digestion, multivitamins and minerals!!! Than a small meal around 11am (cheese or fruit, almonds...protein bar...) and drink water because fibres needs water so your digestion would work!!!!! before my traditional lunch (Croats like to eat meat and potatos, salade, soup, dessert!!!) I took my herbs and vitamins, drink water... Around 4pm I took more fruit, almonds...protein bar..., water... And for dinner I eat my shake meal in summer strawberry flavour with fresh strawberries, ice and juice all blended in the most delicious shake you ever tried!!!! So I wasn't hungry, din't have 500 calories diet - actually I had 2000 calories diet!!!!!!!! That is important!!! And drink a lots of water (because you need it for all vital functions - 70-80% of our body is made of water :)) ), i didn't drink cola or any gas drinks - personally I don't like them and they give you cellulite :))) I don't know about other companies and their products - what they do to your body, BUT I am fully convinced in results with HERBALIFE products... Maybe if you try their shakes you would agree with me :) Ther is one IMPORTANT THING - if you want better and unbelivable result you need to exercise at least 30 minutes EVERY day - but fast walking is also an execise so that's not so hard, am i right?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>The only way to lose weight and maintain it is by changing your eating/training/sleeping lifestyle for ever. IF not, you will always gain more weight than what you lost and this is why people who diet a lot tend to get fatter as they age. It is not a temporary thing. It is a lifestyle change. So, you need to not deprive yourself completely for everything you like at once. msg me if you need any help. I know a lot about this topic and I have helped many others get to their goals.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I haven't tried any pill and I would suggest you stay away from them, they either don't work or compromise your health. I lost all my pregnancy weight by keeping active, going for long walks and doing excersise at home (particularly dancing to MTV!). I do not eat a lot because never had a big appetite and always get stomach pains if I over eat, but I eat pretty much what I want, just small quantities. So that's my secret: Excersise and eat everything in small portions. Now, I want to get fat. Has anyone any secrets for putting on weitht?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>No works outs for me...find them really boring :(. I used to go to the Corniche everyday and walk fast for two hours. I have started doing it again as it gets cooler, not so much because I want to lose weight but because it makes me feel wonderful. Wow, with two little ones no wonder you don't find the times to look after your diet. Maybe try not to skip meals, but instead doing big meals eat little things often just to speed up your metabolism? Yup, I'm skinny now, I'm happiest with my body when I'm between 50 and 55 kg. I think curvier women and much sexier than skinnier ones so don't stress too much about losing weight as long as you are healthy and feel good about yourself.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>i do feel good about myself, whatever i do is to boost my self image for myself a bit more and feel more happier.i had managed to lose the weight the first time round, but this time its taking a bit longer so at times feel dejected. i was thinking of jumpstarting the loss by trying actrim but cant do it since i am still feeding my baby. wow 2 hours is a good time to walk, i shud do that provided my husband agress to sit with the babies, thats the problem, not enough time. i am disciplined with home workouts, quite obsessive infact,i have my own workout figured out, but no consistency cos i do it religiously for 3 weeks, then my kids are sick for a week during which they dont leave my side and by the end of 10days they have given the infection to me. so 2 weeks is lost recuperating and i need to start all over again. this has been going on for the past 4months, and i have managed only 3kg. i too dont exercise for the figure factor, but for health as i need to, have a predisposition to diabetes and hypertension, saw both of it during my pregnancy, so its already a lifestyle change for me. i should try 2 hour walk at corniche, i love walking there no matter what weather, have u tried walking briskly during winters, its crazy, but feels good at the end of it. i used to walk for 50mins when i cud take that time out. do u have kids?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>mine is almost 14 months old. Last winter it was easy to go for brisk walks...you know, sit her on her stroller and just push her and run up and down the corniche...she would be asleep within ten minutes. But now she insists in getting out of the pushchair and walking as well so is a little bit more difficult!. Maybe the weith you put on during the second pregnancy takes a little bit longer to come off. Maybe you are holding onto some fat while you are still breastfeeding and it will come off once you wean your baby, I heard that happens often. Anyways 3 kg in four months sounds fine,pregnancy weight always take longer to get rid of, just keep your diet and work outs and go for walks whenever you can and I'm sure you will slim down :)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>thanks for the boost. i asked u about kids, cos i have another problem, my baby girl is a year old, but she just does not sleep though the night even if she is fully fed. she sleeps with me, but is figdety all through the night, even if i self feed her, she wont take it at one go, but just go off to sleep and then starts the cycle of waking up every hour. so my sleep is totally jacked up,i go to sleep by 2am and am up by 9am.she does not even sleep early at night, even if i skip her evening nap, and put her early to bed at night, she will assume that as her evening nap and would be up by 11pm, and then she is dancing till 1 or 2 am. any ideas how to solve this problem.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Its a simple equation. What you eat - energy you consume = net fat gain/loss. You either eat less or use up more energy. There is no magic potion, pill or diet. You have to make a lifestyle change. Small changes in lifestyle (substituting skimmed for full fat milk, avoiding fried food etc etc) will mean a gradual weight loss but its more likely to become permenant. Other helpful hints include increasing muscle mass to increase metabolism and eating most of your calories early on in the day. No night binging.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I'm not expert but I reckon at this age her nutricionial requirements should be covered during the day, she shouldn't need feeding at all during the nighttime...maybe she is just thirsty? Try giving her water everytime she wakes up. Otherwise, horrible as it sounds, maybe you can just let her cry it out. 1 year babies know how to use crying not to only to communicate basic needs but just to get some attention. Perhaps if you ignore it for a couple of nights, she will learn that crying at night will not get her what she wants (your attention) and realise that nights are for sleeping. hope it helps</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi Buttercuple, do away with fastfood (chips, deep fried chicken) as first they are unhealthy. I don't think there's anything wrong with rice, pasta or bread as long as you eat them in moderation. Tayo kasing mga pinoy, rice in the am, lunch and pm :), pero cguro kapag isang cup lang per serving wala nang second serving ok pa din un. Eating a balanced diet and exercise (aerobic exercise at least 30 mins a day) is the best. If this doesn't work, meron akong produkto which is a slimming program na introduce sayo...just pm me ok.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>There is no "One diet for all"....we all have different body types, metabolisms, activity levels, etc... Cutting out carbs is one way to reduce your caloric intake (like the atkins diet)....but unless its a permanent change (ie lifestyle change and not just a diet for a certain period), the weight tends to return. Generally speaking (unless there are medical reasons mostly to do with metabolism), a person's weight is a function of how many calories they itake, and how many they work off (by exercising)....and exercising doesn't JUST mean the gym.... The best Advice I can give you is not to follow a pre printed diet, but go to a nutritionist who can tailor a diet for your specific body type and needs...at least that's what I would do in Canada....I don't even know if there are certified nutritionists in Qatar. Hope that helps...and whatever you decide, good luck. Stay safe. Perfection does not exist. The question therefore, is: what level of imperfection are we willing to settle for?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>everyone is differant, but to lose weight it has to be a lifstyle change as once you go of the diet you can actually put more weight back on eat sesable and exersise. A doctor once told me try to avoid worring about actually how much you weigh and go for apperance. following a low carb diet works you mainly limit the intake of what are known to be BAD carbs things like to much rice,pasta, bread dont forget there are good carbs and you need these when you exersice to help develop mussle i suggest eating a bannana before exersiceing as this gives you energy as well as helps with the fat burning procces. when switching from a poor diet to a more structured one try taking a good multi vitamin just to help kick start everything again. Also try just changing eating habits make sure you eat a good breakfast and switch your main meal to the middle of the day as thats when we require the most energy also try not to eat more than 2-3 hours before bed.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>altima rocks.. when compared to accord and camry.. i used all three.. when honda feels light, camry feels like a skate board where the nissan scores as an athlete!!!!! smooth, reliable, high revving, high torque engine in it's class!!!!! and ofcourse it has better air conditioning and comfort than other two... (personal opinion) when it comes to the maintenance,nissan is more durable than other two. nissan's service is prompt. as i have seen. in my opinion, go for altima if you want cool executive car... best of luck:) check this tread. it's all abt toyoyta... http://www.qatarliving.com/node/74554</RelCText>

			<RelCText>What is maintenance cost?&gt;&gt;&gt;Depends on the part to be replaced. But yes a little over than the japanese counterpart but not everything in it. spare parts are available easily?&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes! Unless it's a rare Renault. how is petrol/fuel consumption? A Clio has 16 valves which would mean it's fuel efficient, but hey, you're in the mideast where water is more expensive than petrol! Balance this: a 2006 Toyota Corolla will ranged between 36K to 38K against a 16K Clio. A car will depend on how you use and maintain it. You ever read of a bad review about the Clio?

			<RelCText>Aisha - do you or someone you know have a personal experience with him??? I for sure will get atleast a consultation with him. Amoud - He was born with big tonsils but his pediatrician had said to leave it alone, but about a 2yr back he was diagnosed with ragweed allergy, whihc back in canada would start around spring and last till fall, and soon after that he started to snore at night, so he was sent to ENT who said its his Adenoids that are large and while they are removing that they will also remove the tonsils, but after moving to Doha last summeer he quit snoring and came back in winter, so i personally think its allregy of somesort that triggers the adenoids to become large, so I am hoping to consult few good ENT and pediatrician to get thier opinion and go from there on.</RelCText>

I dont have a lot of faith in Drs. here, you get some great ones at times but I am not sure about them when it comes to cutting my kids. I waited to get some stuff done when I went back to Canada for vacation. Even for myself, I contacted my Dr. by email and as he knew my history etc and what I wanted done I scheduled the procedure before I came (although I ended up paying but at least you know you are in good hands). ____________________________________________________ "Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock - Will Rogers"</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Buddy, go through your contract, signed and agreed between you and your employer. Read thoroughly the clauses especially the "Termination of Contract". In normal course, either party can terminate the contract with 1 to 7days notice subject to the terms and conditions specified on the contract. If you terminate the contract within the probation period, you will have to pay a lump sum amount to the employer towards the cost of visa, medical, and other expenses if any. Also you will have to buy the ticket from your pocket. However the employer has no right to hold u back but can ban you for 2 years without providing an NOC. So think twice... gud luck...</RelCText>

			<RelCText>regarding probationary period and contract termination. Usually, there are provisions for terminating contract by either party. The most important thing here is sincerity, and I hope the family problem you are mentioning is real. I read some of your past comments on some threads and I'm really having a second thought about your real intention. Actually, it should have been a different story if you had not submitted a resignation letter but since you have already, my advice is, if you are still within the probationary period, submit a letter of termination for your contract or submit an irrevocable resignation stating your reasons. Then study the Qatar Labor Law as to what are the consequences of such actions. But do not abscond but wait 'til they accept your letter. MAke sure you have a receipt copy of your letter bearing the date it was pass and received by the company!</RelCText>

			<RelCText>its better for you to tell to your boss honestly what is happening, and I believe he will understand your situation. Saeedkan is correct, your boss finds you suitable for your job, that is why he is having a hard time, or even already decided to keep you within the company. I can suggest, apply for an EMERGENCY LEAVE, that way at least, you can assure your boss that you are coming back. Once in the Philippines, way all your options and decide if you are coming back or not, but still THE BEST WAY IS TO COME BACK, of course, for you and for your family's good. Definitely, your boss wants to keep you, so the best way is to assure him your coming back. In that way he will have peace and no worries.</RelCText>

Emails - starfishkids@hotmail.com creativechildqatar@yahoo.com marry_poppins@qatar.net.qa (yes two "r"s) Also, is there a Qatar Embassy in Canada? If so, give them a call and see if they can send you a copy of the Marhaba book. The Embassy in the US sent us one before we moved over. Lots of basic info on Qatar/Doha and pictures.

Obviously these companies have separate organized daycare places it's not like bring your kid to office day ... We have some companies like that in Morocco and I'm thinking there must be some in here as well Boxbe I respect your point of view but I totally disagree with it, daycare can only help reduce the stress level for working moms (and some dads whom care enough) , just like having a staff lounge or a gym. It ll mak business a little more human I don't see why it should reflect any negativity on its image. Unless you think a woman's place is at home etc ... then I won't debate it. Its true my kids need me that's why im searching for better job environment khalliwalli ... i really hope u r wrong. i don't see why they wouldn't do it since Qatar is pretty much family oriented .. from what i have seen. and it's not like they can't afford it ?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Boxbe do you really wana be this judgmental and question the need for a mother ? daycare is what parents want it to be. Not everyone see it as a way to get rid of their own kids. It is a way safer way to return to work rather that maids. I have seen horrors in some nurseries which were not cheap at all so I wouldn't put my children in there for anything in this world. So yeah mothers might need help with the kids but it doesn't make us unfit it just makes us human. Molten I have made the choice to be at home since I had my first son and I thought I would do it again. 2 twins later i'm being outnumbered by babies even with a maid and let's face it money is gona be a major issue soon. bringing my mom was temporary and expensive ... we are expats there is no cousins sisters around ... so we need a permanent solution. i should say my elder (1.5 yr) enjoys other toddlers company so it ll be a great way for him to socialize.. the high heels noise is a good point though</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Better to leave your kids at home with an illiterate maid who beats your kids than in a workplace controlled daycare center staffed by professionals. That's the mentality in this country. You can tell by the way the kids behave in the malls!

They come from countries with, umm, different, values.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>There is a regulated nursery service in doha but at premium rates and difficult to obtain a place, and now due to new regulations there are a reduced number of places. but with careful search you should be able to find a Nursery place. Do ask to see their Ministry registration. Outside of this there is the home provision by employing a Nanny, which is a costly activity initially. There is also many who will offer the service privately unregulated. Its your choice who you trust this small child with. Child care should be planned proir to the babys birth. we have nine months to plan for this day and children deserve the best decisions from us . check Doha Mums website . good Luck.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi I am a British expat living and working in Doha for 12 years and we have always had our local health card costing Qr 100 . People are spoilt here with having private insurance and don't know how good the local services are. Why pay for a private clinic.? All they are interested in is making profit. Go to the government run clinics and everything is subsidised by the government here. Money is no object! You get the best. I have had two major operations done here in Hamad hospital. I have been going to a local clinic for 12 years and had excellent care. They refer you straight to a specialist if they suspect anything wrong. I have had in the last month a colonoscopy, and endoscopy , seen a heart specialist and had a complete medical to check there is nothing going on that could cause future problems. All because I am over 50 and these checks can save lives in the future. Excellent care here. This would never happen in the UK. You would be on a wait list for a year at least to just see one specialist and have one procedure. Each procedure , done under sedation only cost me Qr75 . For a paltry sum of Qr100 I recommend the health care in Qatar. Of course you wait a little when you go for your check up. Not like the private hospitals, but for the standard of care here it's well worth it.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>the cost of living is very high. And yes, accommodation is steep! my husband and I stayed there for 2 years, and we weren't able to save much. but transport system is the best -- you will hardly feel the need for a car :P sights and tourist spots are incomparable; shopping is amazing -- all the big brands are there -- a bit expensive though; food selection is wide and soo yummy :) As far as I remember, income tax for expats is around 15% per month. But at the end of the year, all the tax you paid will be given back to you, and you just pay the government 15% of that amount. That why we looove tax filing season in Singapore, like the months of May to June, because you get back all the tax you paid so it feels like Xmas bonus that time of the year. And you remit only 15% of that to the government :D ***lucky*wifey***</RelCText>

			<RelCText>1. A very Clean City 2. Goverment impose Income Tax 3. "Nothing is Free" you want something you have to pay for it, try using the MRT toilets. 4. A vast variety of food to choose. Try the Chili Crabs. 5. Electronics are cheap and updated. The Great Singapore Sale 6. Justice System is swift and fair, any dispute is usually settle within a week max. 7. Public Transport is very efficient Second to Japan in my opinion. 8. Singaporeans are very polite and well-mannered. All of them served the Armed Forces until a certain age expect some locals to be recalled for "Active Duty" every now and Then. 9. Cost of Living is very Steep, most of your income will go to your monthly rental unless company provide you one. 10. Family Entertainment is perfect. 11. Night Life is well and alive. 12. No restriction in buying Alcohol. 13. Just avoid the bubble gum and the temptation to take any flowers and/or fruits from the trees located within the city. That spell trouble if you get caught. 14. The Red Light District is Sanction by the Goverment. All the "employees" have permits, pay and fill-up their income taxes form. Mostly expats 15. Over there Durian is the King of All Fruits.

			<RelCText>Don, I'm English but living in Turkey. I spent 15 years with the old (Qatar General Petroleum Corporation...now QP and that covers the entire oil/gas sector) and yes there are ups and downs. Social provisions (Company facilities) have deteriorated over the years but the developments in Qatar have probably made up for that. Another plus is that the country is now far more tolerant of Western behaviour and habits. Be warned about the housing costs. QP at one time provided free housing and utilities (including phone line rental). They then applied a limit to electricity and water useage after which you pay and I'm not sure if they pay for the phone line now (unless it's required for the job). If housing is provided I suggest that you take it. You will see from other posts how the cost of housing has risen. Ask QP all the questions to which you require answers. Whatever you decide to do.......... good luck.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Mine was rejected because of Qatarization issues. Since the company I am joining is not meeting its target, the Ministry of Labour decided to block most of its overseas hiring, therefore mine was blocked. It took them around 9 days to issue the rejection, and then 4 more days to change their mind when my company submitted a letter inviting them to review the situation. What I would say is that your application is stuck with the CID normally. It might take them few more days to process your papers. In the meantime ask your company if this is normal. If they tell you this is fine you do not need to worry about it then it is fine. The only problem would be to manage your situation financially during this time, as I assume you are now paying your own rent.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>OMG if i wanted to put my kids on the school bus, it would collect my kids an hour and a half before school starts. They would have to sit on that bus going around the houses having probably woken up about 5am in the morning !!!!!!!! Then of course they would have the same long and tedious journey home!!!!!! If they car in a private car the journey takes takes only 35 mins! Now tell me what would you choose, bus or car??? Alot of employees are also given their accommodation and are unable to live near the school and this in turn increases the volume of traffic on the roads. We could also ask, why are so many schools built next to each other. It is not unusual to see 6 schools built right next to each other and drop off and pick up is nothing short of a nightmare. I can't understand why planning permission has been given to allow this! Personally i think that schools and offices should have different starting times but that's only my opinion.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>When you remove the battery, the memory loss the sync data with the car's immobilizer, hence your key will not start the engine, and your remote won't work. You might still start the engine but it will shut off right after. You can program yourself if you can follow the instruction correctly. Instruction: google, is your friend. OR this instruction:(work for my 2000 model beetle) Insert main key into the ignition lock &amp; switch on the ignition (do not start engine). Using second key lock the vehicle from the outside manually. Hold door locked for 15 seconds. Release key. Press unlock/lock one time, wait at least two seconds or more. Press unlock/lock button, wait at least two seconds or more. Manually open car using key in door lock. Remove key from ignition. Test your remote.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Its better if the sponsor goes to the immigration to extend the visa but firstly the sponsor has to fill (get it typed) the visa renewal application form and sign it. You may submit the renewal form to the immigration pay QR. 50/- and the visa will be extended for another 14 days.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>so I hope QHell wont mind me tagging my query on to this thread and maybe will have the answer I'm looking for. I have invited my sister to visit us in Doha in January. I haven't booked her flight yet and know that we can obtain a 14 day visitor's visa for her on arrival at DIA. My question is this. If she would like to stay for, say, 3 weeks and so I book a return flight for that duration, what happens at DIA when she arrives with a return ticket dated 3 weeks after her arrival? I can see from QHell's post that it shouldn't be a problem to extend her Visa at the Airport AFTER her arrival but, if immigration see her visit is for THREE weeks, will they still issue her with a TWO week visa irrespective of what her ticket says? Grateful to anyone who may have the answer to this. QHell? What was the duration of YOUR visitor's return flight ticket, please. I guess it was for a stay longer than 2 weeks, otherwise you wouldn't have wanted to extend the Visa. [img_assist|nid=57285|title=|desc=|link=none|align=right|width=|height=0]</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Are you talking about the visa or my sister's air ticket? I will purchase her ticket before we leave the UK and I'm trying to find out if it's OK to book her for a 3 week return ticket. It's my understanding that you can only get a Visa for 14 days on arrival, but then extend it later if you want to. What I'm asking is if it's OK to book her ticket for a 3-week return, even though the Visa will be for 14 days (initially). Will immigration query her ticket. Do you see what I mean? lol OH! And if you DO mean the ticket, then it would cost me a LOT more than QR100-200 to change the return date. I buy the cheapest ticket I can and those aren't 'changeable' unless you pay a lot of money to do so. [img_assist|nid=57285|title=|desc=|link=none|align=right|width=|height=0]</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I have come here 3 times to visit my Husband beofe finally come here to live. Even though I told them I was here for 2 weeks holiday and my ticket had the return date on, each time at the airpot they automatically gave me a month visa. One of the times my Mum was with me &amp; they also gave her a 1 month visa. So I would presure that they will automatically give your sister the same. Unless anyone else know different.

			<RelCText>The service is good, reliable and let's say 4-5 times less expensive than their own shipping rates without this facility. First 1/2 kg costs you 8 dollars and it is 5.50 for each additional 1/2kg. Mind you, when it comes from US, the weight will be in pounds, so how they calculate the charge, beats me. The fact is that I have never paid more than 70 reals for my purchases from Amazon.com. Be careful, though, don't get your mailbox address on a junk mailing list, otherwise you will end up paying 8 dollars per each crappy catalogue or leaflet which will come on your name. I buy everything from Amazon.com (and most of the companies do sell through amazon.com) and nothing happened so far. Timewise it takes the package approximately 3-4 (rarely more than that) days to get to Doha, from the moment it arrives in your mailbox in US. UK takes 1-2 days. So far I am very happy with their service. My only complain is that they don't deliver, you have to go and fetch it yourself. But they do send you SMS, and there is tracking of items in your mailbox online. Check them at www.aramex.com/shopandship/ There is one more service www.ushopweship.com Supposedly they filter junk mail, but being happy with Aramex I have never tried them.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Camel Jockey the 551 QR was clearly not just for actual, Qatari customs duties which are only 5%, even when they apply. Perhaps you could ask what they related to? i.e. export duties from the country you bought from? sounds suspicious to me although the "and charges" usually means they dont have to justify anything to you.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>My last shipment was held in customs for nearly 3 weeks in June (about 6 weeks before Ramadan). As mine were books and non-medical or food related that had nothing to do with the delay. Someone suggested that (a) the inspector (as in only one) was on holiday or that (b) a new competitor with more wasta was able to delay the shipment. I don't believe either. But it was very frustrating waiting for it to be cleared when it normally takes about 5 - 10 days from the time I order for it to be available to be picked up.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>for any orders to Qatar Thomann charge 40 euros, so if you make a large order it is well worth it. If you keep the cost of the order below 3000qar then there is no import duty at all. I only once had to pay duty (200qar) on an order which was over 6500qar. I ordered a shed load of stuff for my band. DHL normally deliver the item directly to your address, if however customs are unsure what it is, it will end up at Q-post. Been there a few times.

			<RelCText>Ok, I do know that BC pills are available over the counter. I know they do prescribe anxiety drugs, but you have to find a psychiatrist/psychologist to do that and they are rare here.

			<RelCText>@ han19 Thanks! Yeah, I think stress adds more to her problem that's why I told her that she must not think about the pimple problem because it will only add up. She also mentioned about the water in qatar, she said it's a bit different of what we have here in the Philippines. Whenever she takes a facial wash, she uses boiled water (cooled of course) for rinsing. The cosmetics that I would send her is recommended by a dermatologist, but unfortunately, our government won't allow it. @ kiarajane are you filipina? it looks like you're filipina because you know RDL, and Liwanag is a Filipino word... anyways, thanks for the reply...

			<RelCText>If your friend is already conceived and she would like to get rid of it in the very early stage then there is no way to get the medicine in any of the pharmacies or on counter. Qatar is an Islamic country and they do not allow such things here that is why medicines are not sold here. I do remember that they stopped selling such medicines in the begining of 1980. I know that in most of the countries you will get some medicines for bringing back the mestural cycle if you are in doubt of pregnancy in the very early stage. If you are talking about contraceptive pills they are available in pharmacies.</RelCText>

When we drove back to Qatar, I was expecting to be collared at the border but nothing was said. So my question is this: Have I got away with it or not? I hope the UAE traffic fines are not linked to Qatar MOI? But what if we ever go back to the UAE - will we be fined then? Or what about transiting through Dubai airport?

Even in this case the procedure is way too long and you might end up with giving to the lawyers much more money than you are owed... ********************* “You become responsible forever for what you have tamed”.

			<RelCText>Qatar criminal and civil procedures are unique in the entire gulf region. It has both the regular courts and the sharia courts. For estafa or deceit, it is normally filed with a complaint with the prosecutor and after preliminary investigation, it will be filed with the Court of First Instance. You need not hire a lawyer since the prosecutor will be your lawyer. But bear in mind to produce evidence on estafa or deceit. If you have no documentary exhibits forget your complaint and charge it to experience. Sharia courts handle family relations law and criminal cases involving Qataris and muslim litigants. Cases involving foreigners, civil or criminal are handled by regular courts.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Evidence is very important in criminal prosecution. Oral testimony will not prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt, the quantum of evidence required to convict an accused in a criminal prosecution. The rejoinder of qatarisun is well taken, your respondent can easily deny having received money from you or simply say that the money is simple loan, and you have no case for estafa. The essential element of estafa is "trust" and "exchange of goods or money". Prove this both and you have a case for estafa.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Good dentists are not cheap. Remember the saying when you pay peanuts you get monkeys??? Well that also applies to your dentist. You guys want to be paid for a good job done, so do the dentists. Your teeth are an important part of your well being. So you should get the best. There are several dentists that do a good job, which includes Dr Sarrah's clinic. They use the right materials and do the right procedures. Ofcourse you can try a CHEAP place but remember, they are taking shortcuts some where.....and in the end you are paying for it. I was discussing with my dentist the fact that there were so many new dental clinics opening all over Doha and if this was a worry to him. He said that no way, he was not worried at all cos he said that he had heard from the medical rep that the first questions these new clinics were asking: "What is the cheapest we can buy?" This was in relation to equipment and materials.....so......do you want the cheapeststuff used on you? No not me, I rather go to a reputable dentist and get a good job/treatment. However the choice is your. And by the way I am not a patient of Dr Sarrah, but I know she is good, cos the good dentists hang around together and discuss cases. And Dr Sarrah is highly talked about by my own dentist. Aisha-Taweela</RelCText>

			<RelCText>yep american models are NTSC but 110v and the ones you buy here are NTSC and 110v or you can buy the asian version. You'll notice the difference from how they are packed. US versions have free games and the package is black, while asian version are somewhat ash and no free games,just the console and are 220v. About the NTSC or PAL. You really dont have to worry about it because newer TV systems Support both PAL and NTSC systems. If you have an HDTV in uk, then you got no problems at all. *unless you got those really-really old school TVs.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Yes Qatar has 220v. But dont worry, I suggest you buy a separate Power Supply for your PS3 which would likely be 110v if you're taking the US version PS3. Power Supplies are like boxes, like the ones you see under computers. Computers need a separate Power Supply. They both got 220v and 110v. Make sure its 110v if you're going to plug it in 110v, DONT plug the US version ps3 in 220v, or else you'll get a brand new 500$ Paper Weight.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Contrary to what Qatari advises, the PS3 is region FREE. Meaning that any region game will work with the ps3. Having said that, i think there are DVD movie restrictions. The PS3's voltage doesn't matter either because they have built in regulators. I myself have a white Japanese PS3 (bought in Qatar) and it works perfectly find with everything. Just make sure you buy an HD cable if you have an HD tv since PS3's don't come with that. The Middle East's standard system is PAL. However you can get NTSC-J NTSC-UC and PAL all over in stores. I recommend the NTSC-UC (US, for movies because they come out later). At the end of the day it doesn't really matter what you get. ___________________________ Click here for LOADS of Qatar info  I♥Q  &amp;lt;-- (Expat and Local Info)</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I don't have a BB, and I also I'm not on Qtel ( as I'm in Saudi ! ) but there is a piece of software that I use called Joikuspot.

Obviously the Light version has restrictions, which the Premium version does not. Once you install and run it, the mobile phone will connect to the interent using the phone's data connection.

			<RelCText>nope. I meant that android products have a lower shelf life irrespective of whether they support flash or have apps.

			<RelCText>Hi, A friend of mine told me following : I've been in Doha since 98. I was employed in Ras Gas for 3 years as a contractor. They have a good package for new direct employees. The housing is situated in Al Khor (70 km from Doha) they provide schooling in their complex. As a company Ras Gas are one of the main employeers in Ras Laffan. They are present extending their trains to 6 which will increase their production facilities. If your wife can drive its fine, as there is not a lot in Al Khor (no shopping malls, big super markets etc..). It takes at least 1 hour to drive to Doha. Are you already in Doha or not ?</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hey Katuks... If you have been employed directly to Ras Gas, then just do not think. Its the best company here in Qatar and they have all facilities. The accomodation complex is excellent and have all the features required. Yes, its a bit far from the Doha city. But that shouldnt be a problem. Nowadays Ras Gas are shifting some of their personnel to stay in Doha. Maybe after a few years you would be the lucky one. So dont think twice. Go ahead and do your planning to join the company. When the package is excellent, nothing to worry. Cheers ... Bobby</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi SloopJohnD, I have only lived here for a few weeks but will happily offer my humble opinion. I work on the Ras Laffan idustrial estate but not for QatarGas, so I cant give any opinions on QatarGas. It is based very near my company so the commute would be very similar - its not so bad, most of the way is easy - virtually the same road! Doha is the hardest part...the driving is crazy. With a family it is defitiely better to be living in Doha, everything you need is there and you can enjoy a good standard of living, all the schools are there too i think. The people seem ok, crime is very low and you never feel like you would walking the streets in other cities. There are lots of activities all over and if you join a club like the doha club or something you can get family membership. I cant speak for the heat in summer but I would imagine its quite unbearable - but with air con etc it should be fine - and the winter weather is meant to be glorious. There is a book which I got from amazon that came in useful called Qatar - the complete residents guide - that will give you lots of info and really is worth the money. One point which I didnt know is that you can upgrade your driving licence (in the uk anyway) for free to an international driving licence-you need to do it before you arrive. I dont know if you can email me or whatever for more advice but I would be happy to answer any questions. Doha is a good place to live and much better than anywhere near Ras Laffan, theres realy not alot there. Anyway, hope this helps. McSunny</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi. Thought I would give you my two cents worth. My husband had been driving back and forth to Ras Laffan for 8 months. He come to hate the drive! Although it is an easy ride once outside of city, straight highway driving. The drive takes between 45-60 minutes, depending on traffic of course. We moved to the new Dolphin Energy compound and really are enjoying it. Doha is close enough when we want to go into the city to do whatever. Compound life is awesome! Beautiful homes, almost like a small town within the compound! As for children well our youngest is 18 and they are living in Canada, so we didn't have to factor that into the move. However, I would think that compound living with children would be fine too. Certainly would not have to worry about day to day things that you would in a city. Hope this helped somewhat.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>I feel bank to bank transfer will always give you low conversion rate as compared to money exchanges outside. So you should withdraw cash and transfer them using money exchanges outside. For NRE account in India, ICICI, HDFC, even YES bank these days are the best options, from services and network point of view.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Can only say after trying them both that CBQ is much better then Doha bank. Easier procedure for the money withdrawals in the branch, excellent internet banking with international transfers (Doha bank still doing it old fashion way with a hand writing form that takes ages to fill), international ATM withdrawal in EU (Doha bank has a blacklisted countries policy that nobody really knows why is some country actually blacklisted....).

When I inquired, they said it was technical fault. This amount was adjusted after several calls &amp; e-mails; 4) After few years, I went to the bank and requested to close my account.

			<RelCText>Thanks everyone for you help, I went to the traffic department myself this morning. That is correct, the new buyer has to be present with the seller as he is required to sign a document. He also needs a NOC from his company. In my case as I am leaving Qatar before the new buyer returns from vacation, the police have said that I can sign the document and leave it with the duty officer. On the return of the new buyer from vacation, he will just provide the NOC, produce all his QID, drivers license and the transfer will take place although I won't be in Qatar. Thanks all Putsie</RelCText>

			<RelCText>You can try to do the blood test in a private laboratory (about 10 QR) then take the results to where you got the ID from (Probably MOI) ...

Since you are O+, then you shouldn't get any other group than O because it can be fatal. So please, don't leave it like that.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>If you can get a job in HK, i would say you should stay there. Your housing allowance not even enough to rent a room in Doha. I been to HK few times ... with the money you earn, IMO it is not worth it to come all the way here with the salary. Leaving your family and friends behind? Qatar is not a cheap place to live ... i can say nearly not far off from HK in term of housing prices. Price here for looking for somewhere to stay is crazy. And you will miss HK food as soon as you get here.</RelCText>

A two bed room flat rent will cost around qar 7000. for qar 1000 you may get a dormitory accommodation with many sharing. hope you get right company for sharing accommodation. you may, if you have frugal living habits, own cooking, etc, you may spend for living expenses qar 400 - 500. you may spend equal amount in taxi. even more if you have to use mobile call up HK. is this a direct job from Qatar airways or through a contractor?

			<RelCText>Hi leo55699, Qatar Airways (like other organizations) has its grade structure. It consists of 11 grades. I don't know the whole structure but understand that 8-11 are managerial grades. I also received an offer from them (we may joined the same interview section in Central ...). Their offer letter didn't say much background details and I kept clarifying with them. Suggest that you do the same to clear your concerns. P.S.: Personal thought is that you can definitely find a job with a more decent salary package than this in HK now. Job market here is good (from job seekers' side). Take care. F'co a little progress everyday adds up to big results</RelCText>

Coz I still have chance to get into other airline in Hong Kong, therefore, I am not interested on going to Doha with a salary offer like that. Since I have to give up everything in Hong Kong, I think I deserve a better offer. What do you think?? and did they offer you a good package? Best Regard Leo</RelCText>

			<RelCText>Hi leo55699, If they really offer you basic QR3900, then it's too low. You can easily find a job in HK with more than HKD10000 nowadays, esp with degree.

			<RelCText>Your bataka is already expired on 7th June. Yes 3 month grace period after which not renewed there will be fine. it will not be cancelled until and unless you permanently leave qatar, instead you will end up or your company will end up paying fine for the expiry. So let them renew it as soon as possible. however if can only be cancelled until and unless your company cancels it and your ban for 2 years. Yes noc is required if your company is willing to give. In your situation since they are delaying for RP, i doubt they would even give an NOC.</RelCText>

			<RelCText>CBQ is a terrible bank. I tell you that I have been cheated by them. I took a car loan in 2005, agreed with them to pay certain installments (interest included) for 60 months, they have decided to increase their interest (from 7.1% to 11.2%) &amp; decided to extend the period for more than 60 months without even informing me.

			<RelQSubject>Fireworks and the VF 50 Dhs offer is back</RelQSubject>
			<RelQBody>I just wanted to share a couple of things that we've been up to at Vodafone. Yes yes, I know, 'why is amnesia pushing an event and promotion?'. It's because I think it's useful to everyone. So Vodafone's brought back the 50Dirhams promotion. (call any country for 50 dhs until the 14th of February). Nice. Also this Saturday, everyone's invited to come on down to the corniche and enjoy a fireworks show! We'll also have a huge surprise for everyone! Anyway, I'm just excited :P</RelQBody>
